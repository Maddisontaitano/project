Horiseon read me:

This webpage consists of great ways to make it in the work force. It shows how social media and a web presence is beneficial. It also gives you more tips on how to manage a brand in coorporate america. 
All of the images have alt attributes to make usage easier for the user. The title of the page was changed to Horizeon because that fit the basis of the page. All of the non-sematic elements in the source code were very confusing for the coder, so I changed them to sematic elements to make it more consolidated and organized. That was a little challenging because I had to use my researching skills to find the names of the required sematic elements. also, consolidating the css was a challenge but it is now easier to read, and access.
